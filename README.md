I hold an associate degree, received from The University of Uludag, in Computer and Information Systems from 2001 to 2004. After two years, in 2006, I was accepted for Mathematics and Computer Science to the University of Johannes Gutenberg in Mainz but I had to drop the course after a year, then came back to Turkey. During my year at the University of Johannes Gutenberg, I learned German. Furthermore, I completed Java and Android Software Development course instructed by Bilgeadam IT Course in Istanbul, in 2017. At the moment, I'm studying at the University of Istanbul in Management Information Systems for my future carrier.

For the last two years, with the remarkable development of JavaScript technologies, Web projects have required much more intensive use of JavaScript. Therefore, I decided to improve my skills, particularly in JavaScript, Node JS and React. I have developed JavaScript technologies for the corporations I have worked for. For the future, I want to focus on and continue to work in projects which mostly require React, Redux, Typescript, NodeJS and Spring Boot.
